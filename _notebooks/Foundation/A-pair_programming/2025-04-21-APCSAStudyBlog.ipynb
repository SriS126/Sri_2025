    "2. went through each of my team teach hw/lessons to familiarize/get a gist of all topics\n",
    "3. started to go through the collegeboard videos on the units to strengthen knowledge again on those units, took notes on a personal doc\n",
    "4. took about 2 hrs on studying iteration on runestone (most weighted)\n",
    "5. started to do practice MC's \n",
    "6. studied the four questions of the FRQ using the resource below\n",
    "7. familiarized myself with common frq patterns that show up\n",
