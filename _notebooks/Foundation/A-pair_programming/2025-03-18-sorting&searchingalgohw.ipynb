    "1. finds the smallest element (8), swaps it with the most leftmost element (42), end result is [8, 17, 29, 42, 35]\n",
    "2. finds the smallest element from the unsorted part (17), which is already in the correct position, end result is [8, 17, 29, 42, 35]\n",
    "3. finds the smallest element from the unsorted part (29), which is already in the correct position, end result is [8, 17, 29, 42, 35]\n",
    "4. finds the smallest element from the unsorted part (35), swaps it with 42, end result is [8, 17, 29, 35, 42]\n",
    "5. the last element is sorted so, [8, 17, 29, 35, 42]\n",
    "\n",
    "### This process will take 10 comparisons and two swaps\n",
    "\n",
    "### The best case for the selection sort is that it always makes  n(n−1)/2 comparisons, even if the array is already sorted\n",
    "### The worst case for the selectiion sort is that it still makes n(n−1)/2 comparisons, even if the array is in reverse order"
