    "- **Popcorn Hack Usage**: The hacks were well implemented, with both reviews appreciating their inclusion. However, reviewers felt that they could have been more complex or creative.\n",
    "- **Homework**: Covered the necessary topics, with one reviewer suggesting that it could have been more detailed for better engagement.\n",
    "- **Grading Plan**: Clear grading structure based on participation and completion of homework and popcorn hacks. It was fair and well communicated.\n",
    "- **Original and Creative**: While one review mentioned minimal creativity (a few images and a joke), the other praised the creative use of memes and organization, which helped maintain student focus.\n"
