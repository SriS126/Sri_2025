I have issues documenting the team teaches, analytics, sprints, etc, and I feel like these issues are good because they show a time stamp and progress throughout this tri, i have a total of about 20 issues. Regarding analytics and burn down, sometimes in the trimester I was lazy and didn't do some work on some days, not committing and just planning. HOwever, I feel like i have a good burn down and documentation.\n",
