# Version Control
## In the development process, developers use version control. Annotate in your notes what you have learned about version control during this setup process.
- How are the files from GitHub placed on your local machine? How do you navigate to those files?

- The files on github are placed onto my machine by using the "git clone" command. This copies the files from the repository and brings it to my local host. I can navigate the files by going on vscode and clicking through or "cd" command.

- How are the files updated in GitHub? How do you navigate to those files?

The files are updated by making changes to them, then using commits or pushing in github. "git commit" and "git push" are some examples. I can see the changes by going onto the github repo and looking through.

- How would you update your template of the portfolio_2025 repository? How would you make it more applicable to your specific course?

I could add a personal timeline of what we did so far in class, kind of liek CSP where there was a table for each week. I could make it more applicable by adding java hacks which we will learn in the future, or basic java learning content.

# Localhost vs. Deployed Server
## Put into words the difference between viewing GitHub Pages running on your localhost machine versus running on a deployed server.
The difference is that localhost is running in my local machine and can be only seen to me, but a deployed server can be seen by everyone

- What is the localhost URL for your project? Can anyone else see what you see?

Localhost: http://127.0.0.1:4100/student_2025/devops/hacks. No one can see what I see unless they go up to my computer

- What is the GitHub Pages URL for your project? Can anyone else see what you see?
https://sris126.github.io/Sri2025/. They can see what I see on this.

# DNS and GitHub Pages
## DNS is the address manager for the internet. Reflect on the following questions:
- Is there a domain on your GitHub Pages?

Yes, github pages do have a domain, a subdomain too which is 'github.io'

- Is the URL for your GitHub Pages different from your neighborsâ€™ URLs? Did you change the URL? If so, when?

Yeah there is different urls because it depends on the repository name and the username. I did change the url a bit as it says Sri2025.
