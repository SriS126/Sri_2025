# 3.3 If Else Statements

<a id="if-else-statements"></a>
## Purpose of Else Statements
Else statements: Handles what happens when the if condition is false.
Structure of If-Else:
- If statement with a condition.
- Else statement without a condition.
- Both parts have code blocks surrounded by {}.



# don't forget the brackets 


```Java
int x = 20;
if (x > 10) {

    console.log("x is greater than 10");
    console.log("This code when the condition is true");
    } else {
    
    console.log("x is 10 or less");
    console.log("This code runs when the condition is false");
}
//    Without brackets:
        
   console.log("x is greater than 10");
   console.log("this code will always run");
```


    |       console.log("x is greater than 10");

1. Based on this code, if you were younger than 16 what would it print out?
2. Write your own if else statement


```Java
// if I was younger than 16, it would print out "You are not old enough for a license yet."

// if else statement code below
int age = 20; 

if (age < 13) {
    System.out.println("you are very young");
} else if (age >= 13 && age < 20) {
    System.out.println("you are a teenager ");
} else if (age >= 20 && age < 65) {
    System.out.println("your pretty young ig.");
} else {
    System.out.println("hi grandpa");
}

```

    your pretty young ig.
