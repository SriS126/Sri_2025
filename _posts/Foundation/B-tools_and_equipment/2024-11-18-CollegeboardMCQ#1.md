# Score: 31/40
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a7e4d24-1fcc-4357-b4ad-2ee4f83fd993)

## Glows: 
- understanding object-oriented concepts
- manipulating arrays
- methods/interface
- basic array operations

## Grows:
- missing code in loops and recursions
- multiple parameter questions
- class design
- time and focus, a lot of questions made me blank out, and i was unmotivated near the end to answer the long questions

## Goals:
- Review class design again
- solve complex boolean expressions
- practice writing parameters
- review recursion
- spend atleast 30 min over the weekend reviewing team teaches / team teach hws / maybe even collegeboard videos

the method was made private which wouldnt allow it to modify/connect with others
the public getter method ensures controlled access to myC without connectin it directly or allowing modification.

I thought it would send a decimal although it was integers, so Java would truncate the result, silly me

subtraction wasn't absolute, so I thought the sign difference would affect the comparison of d1 and d2. the correct answer makes sure the tolerance accounts for the difference regardless of the order of d1 and d2

i didn't carefully check the loop structure conditins, 1 and 3 correctly iterate and compare the elements and makes sure the array is going in nondecreasing order.

i misunderstood the comparison logic, i incorrectly compared the number to the difference instead of the target value. the correct answer compares the absolute difference between the current number and the target value and then sees which one is closer.

the index adjustments made the elements shifted, which got me wrong. the mainupulation of the list in the correct answer appends k to the new position so it reordered the elements based on the logic

i overlooked seeing if one box fits into another with comparison methods rather than just looking at the dimensions, the correct answer compares the dimensions correctly which is enough for a box to fit in a box

i focused on the behavior of x at point c and didn't account for the changes to it through the loop, x begins at 1 and increments and it will equal 1 sometimes

i misunderstood the logic, || and &&. the correct answer makes sure x and y are evaluated constantly, and my answer would always put it as true
