## Nested conditional statements 

<a id="conditional-statements"></a>

definition: if statements within other if statements 


```Java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 20;
        boolean isStudent = true;

        // Outer if-else block
        if (age >= 18) {
            // Nested if-else block inside the first condition
            if (isStudent) {
                System.out.println("You are an adult and a student.");
            } else {
                System.out.println("You are an adult.");
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("You are not an adult.");
        }
    }
}
```

# Simple Example of a Nested Conditional Statement

Let's look at a **very basic** example of a nested conditional statement using `if-else` blocks. 

### Scenario:
We want to check if a person is an adult and, if they are, we want to know if they are also a student.

# Compound Conditional Statement

A **compound conditional statement** is when two or more conditions are combined into a single `if` statement using **logical operators** like `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), or `!` (NOT). This allows us to check multiple conditions at once without needing to nest `if` statements.

### Logical Operators:
- `&&` (AND): True if **both** conditions are true.
- `||` (OR): True if **at least one** condition is true.
- `!` (NOT): Reverses the result of a condition (true becomes false, and false becomes true).

### Example of a Compound Conditional Statement

Let's say we want to check if a person is an **adult** and **a student** at the same time. Instead of using a nested `if` statement, we can use a compound conditional statement.


```Java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 20;
        boolean isStudent = true;

        // Compound conditional using && (AND)
        if (age >= 18 && isStudent) {
            System.out.println("You are an adult and a student.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Either you are not an adult, or you are not a student.");
        }
    }
}
```

### common mistake: Dangling else 
    - Java does not care about indentation
    - else always belongs to the CLOSEST if
    - curly braces can be use to format else so it belongs to the FIRST 'if'

### Popcorn hack
- explain the purpose of this algorithm, and what each if condition is used for
- what would be output if input is 
    - age 20
    - anual income 1500
    - student status: yes


```Java
function checkMembershipEligibility() {
    // Get user input
    let age = parseInt(prompt("Enter your age:"));  // Age input
    let income = parseFloat(prompt("Enter your annual income:"));  // Annual income input
    let isStudent = prompt("Are you a student? (yes/no):").toLowerCase() === 'yes';  // Student status input

    // Initialize an empty array to hold results
    let results = [];

    // Check eligibility for different memberships

    // Basic Membership
    if (age >= 18 && income >= 20000) {
        results.push("You qualify for Basic Membership.");
    }

    // Premium Membership
    if (age >= 25 && income >= 50000) {
        results.push("You qualify for Premium Membership.");
    }

    // Student Discount
    if (isStudent) {
        results.push("You are eligible for a Student Discount.");
    }

    // Senior Discount
    if (age >= 65) {
        results.push("You qualify for a Senior Discount.");
    }

    // If no eligibility, provide a default message
    if (results.length === 0) {
        results.push("You do not qualify for any memberships or discounts.");
    }

    // Output all results
    results.forEach(result => console.log(result));
}

// Call the function to execute
checkMembershipEligibility();
```

# Purpose 
the algorithm checks eligibility for memberships or discounts based on age, income, and student status

# Conditions
- **Basic Membership:** Age ≥ 18, Income ≥ 20,000.
- **Premium Membership:** Age ≥ 25, Income ≥ 50,000.
- **Student Discount:** Must be a student.
- **Senior Discount:** Age ≥ 65.
- **Default:** If none apply, a message is shown.

# Output
"you are eligible for a student discount"


## Popcorn Hack #2
- Write a program that checks if a person can get a discount based on their age and student status. You can define your own discount criteria! Use compound conditionals to determine the output.


```Java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 30; // Change this value for testing
        boolean isStudent = true; // Change this value for testing

        // Your compound conditional logic here
    }
}
```


```Java
int age = 35; // Change this value for testing
boolean isStudent = true; // Change this value for testing

if (age >= 65) {
    System.out.println("you qualify for a Senior Discount.");
} else if (age >= 18 && isStudent) {
    System.out.println("you qualify for a Student Discount.");
} else if (age < 18) {
    System.out.println("you qualify for a Youth Discount.");
} else {
    System.out.println("no discounts are available for you.");
}

```

    you qualify for a Student Discount.
