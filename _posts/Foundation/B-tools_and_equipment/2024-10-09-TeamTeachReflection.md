### Summary of Comments:
- **College Board Coverage**: Both reviews indicate solid coverage of College Board content, though it could have gone more in-depth to exceed expectations.
- **Java Examples**: Strong examples provided, clear and easy to understand. Reviewers noted that the examples were specific to each bullet point and very effective for teaching.
- **Popcorn Hack Usage**: The hacks were well implemented, with both reviews appreciating their inclusion. However, reviewers felt that they could have been more complex or creative.
- **Homework**: Covered the necessary topics, with one reviewer suggesting that it could have been more detailed for better engagement.
- **Grading Plan**: Clear grading structure based on participation and completion of homework and popcorn hacks. It was fair and well communicated.
- **Original and Creative**: While one review mentioned minimal creativity (a few images and a joke), the other praised the creative use of memes and organization, which helped maintain student focus.
