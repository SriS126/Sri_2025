Reflection: 

# 1. 5 things over this tri (4.5)
I believe I deserve a *4.5* in this category. I have issues documenting the team teaches, analytics, sprints, etc, and I feel like these issues are good because they show a time stamp and progress throughout this tri, i have a total of about 20 issues. Regarding analytics and burn down, sometimes in the trimester I was lazy and didn't do some work on some days, not committing and just planning. HOwever, I feel like i have a good burn down and documentation.

# 2. Full Stack Feature Demo (1.5)
I believe I deserve a 1.5 in this category. I didn't do much backend and only coded loading the questions in and different npc interactions, i worked a lot on frontend and helping connect the backend. 

# 3. Key Feature Writeup (1)
- I believe I deserve a 1 in this category. I have a blog documenting my feature progress and how I did it, and have visualizatioins.

# 4. MCQ/FRQ Work (1)
- I believe i deserve a 1 in this as I have reflections on CB and corrections.

# 5. Extra 10th point from impression/extra stuff (1)
I believe I deserve a 1 in this as I did/going to do atleast 3 of the beyond perfunctory stuff/prepping.
