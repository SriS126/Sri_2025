int otherAge = 45; 
```
using these integers, determine weather the following statements are True or False

## Strings

## popcorn hack 
whats wrong with this code? (below)


```Java

String myName = "Alisha"; //names should be in parantheses because they are strings

myName != "Anika";
myName == "Alisha";
```




    true



comparison of string objects should be done using String methods, NOT integer methods. 

- .equal
- compare to


```Java
String myName = "Alisha";
boolean areNamesEqual = myName.equals("Alisha");  

if (areNamesEqual) {
    System.out.println("True");
} else {
    System.out.println("False");
}

```

    True

The preconditions for the num is for it to be a non-negative integer and it should have between one and six digits!
