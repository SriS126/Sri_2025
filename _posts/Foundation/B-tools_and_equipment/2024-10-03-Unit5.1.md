# Anatomy of a Class
This notebook will explain the structure of a class in Java, including attributes, methods, and instantiation. It will also include examples and a mini-project that requires fixing broken code.

## 1. Introduction to Classes
- A class in Java is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a data structure that includes methods and attributes.
- Example:





```java
public class Car {
    // Attributes
    String model;
    int year;

    // Method
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving the car.");
    }
}

```

This `Car` class has attributes `model` and `year`, and a method `drive()` that prints a message.

## 2. Attributes and Methods
- Attributes (or fields) are variables that belong to an object.
- Methods are functions that belong to a class.
- Example:




```java

public class Person {
    // Attributes
    String name;
    int age;

    // Method
    void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + name);
    }
}
```

In this `Person` class, `name` and `age` are attributes, and `greet()` is a method.

## 3. Constructor
- Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects.
- They have the same name as the class and do not have a return type.
- Example:





```java
public class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    // Constructor
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + name);
    }
}

```

This `Person` class includes a constructor to initialize `name` and `age`.

## 4. Class vs. Instance Variables
- **Instance variables** are attributes specific to each object.
- **Class variables** (static variables) are shared among all instances of the class.
- Example:





```java
public class Car {
    // Class variable
    static int numberOfCars = 0;

    // Instance variables
    String model;
    int year;

    // Constructor
    public Car(String model, int year) {
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
        numberOfCars++;
    }
}

```

Here, `numberOfCars` is a class variable that keeps track of how many `Car` objects have been created.

## 5. Mini Project: Fix the Code
- Below is a class with broken code. The goal is to fix the class so it properly initializes and uses instance variables.
- Broken code:


- **Task**: Debug the `Book` class so it correctly initializes `title` and `author`. Consider how the constructor should be modified.


```java
public class Book {
    String title;
    String author;

    public Book(String title, String author) {
        this.title = title;   
        this.author = author; 
    }
}

```

- **Task**: Debug the `Book` class so it correctly initializes `title` and `author`. Consider how the constructor should be modified.
