### popcorn hack
create test cases that do not satisy the condition above. you can copy/paste the code into the new code cell


```Java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int myAge = 16;
    System.out.println("Current age: " + myAge);
    
    if (myAge >= 16) {
        System.out.println("You can start learning to drive!");
    }

    System.out.println("On your next birthday, you will be " + (myAge + 1) + " years old!");
}
```


```Java

    int myAge = 15;
    System.out.println("Current age: " + myAge);

    if (myAge >= 16) {
        System.out.println("You can start learning to drive!");
    }

    System.out.println("On your next birthday, you will be " + (myAge + 1) + " years old.");

    myAge = 10;
    System.out.println("\nCurrent age: " + myAge);

    if (myAge >= 16) {
        System.out.println("You can start learning to drive!");
    }

    System.out.println("On your next birthday, you will be " + (myAge + 1) + " years old.");

    //created a test case for 10 and 15 lol


```

    Current age: 15
    On your next birthday, you will be 16 years old.
    
    Current age: 10
    On your next birthday, you will be 11 years old.
