# 3.4 Else If Statements 
Else If Statements: Used when you have multiple conditions that need to be checked sequentially.

Flow of Execution: Each condition is evaluated in the order written. The first true condition's code runs, and the rest are skipped.

Structure:

- Start with a single if statement.
- Follow with as many else if statements as needed.
- Optionally end with one else to handle any remaining cases.
Key Concept: The order of conditions matters. More specific conditions should come before broader ones to ensure accurate results.

1. If I was 19 what would it print out? 
2. If I was 13 what would it print out? 
3. Create your if statement with one else if condition.


```python
// #1 would print "You can register to vote" and "You are old enough for a license to drive"
// #2 you said in class it meant to say 14, so 14

// if statement with one else if condition below
int age = 20;

if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("Adult");
} else if (age >= 13) {
    System.out.println("Teen");
} else {
    System.out.println("Child");
}

```
