# 3.7 Comparing Objects
<a id="comparing-objects"></a>
## short-circuited evaluation: 
expression can be determined by only looking at the first operand. 


```python
function isEven(num) {
    return num % 2 === 0;
}

function isPositive(num) {
    return num > 0;
}

let number = 10;

// Short-circuit with &&
if (isEven(number) && isPositive(number)) {
    console.log(number + " is even and positive.");
} else {
    console.log(number + " does not meet the criteria.");
}

```

## Short-Circuit Behavior:
- && (Logical AND): The expression isEven(number) && isPositive(number) is evaluated.
    - JavaScript first evaluates isEven(number). - If this returns false, the whole expression will short-circuit, and isPositive(number) will not be evaluated.
- If isEven(number) is true, then isPositive(number) is evaluated.

## Comparing Objects

In java there are two different methods to compare objects but there is a difference between the == operator and the equals() method.


```python
## == operator

This operator verifies if two references refer to the same object in memory, without evaluating the objects' values or attributes.
```


```python
Integer num1 = 100;
Integer num2 = 100;
Integer num3 = num1;
Integer num4 = new Integer(100);

System.out.println(num1 == num3); // true (same reference)
System.out.println(num1 == num2); // true (cached integers between -128 and 127)
System.out.println(num1 == num4); // false (different references)
```


```python
This compares the integer as num1 == num3 because they both equal the same integer so it's true. num1 == num2 because when they are both assigned the value 100 they point to the same reference so they become true. num1 == num4 even though they have the same values they are different because it's a new integer so it becomes false because they don't have the same reference point.
```

## equals() method

This method checks the values or attributes of two objects. In custom classes, it is commonly overridden to offer a meaningful comparison based on the class's specific attributes. It focuses on value rather reference points.


```python
Integer num1 = 100;
Integer num2 = 100;
Integer num3 = new Integer(100);

System.out.println(num1.equals(num2)); // true (same value)
System.out.println(num1.equals(num3)); // true (same value)
```

This compares the values by their objects, not their references. num1.equals(num2) checks if the values are the same between the 2 but since they both have a value of 100 they are equal so it becomes true. This ignores if the objects have the same or different reference point. num1.euals(num3) even though it has a new integer and it's different from num1 they are still the same because they have the same value so it makes it true.

## Popcorn hack
Would the sharons house and my house be the same?


```python
class House {
    private String color;
    private int size;

    public House(String color, int size) {
        this.color = color;
        this.size = size;
    }

    // Override equals method to compare House objects by content
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) return true;  // Check if same object reference
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;  // Check if same class
        House house = (House) obj;
        return size == house.size && color.equals(house.color);  // Compare attributes
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        House myHouse = new House("green", 150);
        House anikasHouse = new House("green", 150);
        House sharonsHouse = new House("green", 150);

        // Correct comparison using equals()
        System.out.println(myHouse.equals(sharonsHouse));  // This should return true
    }
}

```

# Yes it would be the same
