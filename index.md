## ðŸŽ® Games

These are some very simple games I made or pasted from last year. 

- **[Snake](https://sris126.github.io/student//2023/08/30/SnakeWeek2.html)**: the classic snake game made by outside sources, i experimented with it last year to understand how it would work
- **[Dodging Game](https://sris126.github.io/student//2023/08/31/RectangleGame.html)**: This is a dodging game me and my partner last year made which involves event listeners and boundaries. Chat GPT helped us a lot with this game

## ðŸ“¢ Socials

Here are some of my socials that you can follow me on or look at. I used github a lot last year for CSP and I am frequently on social media a alot (very bad). 

- **[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sri__s126/?next=%2Fftc_runtimeterror%2F&hl=en)**: i don't post, only a few stories, most of the time im on reels
- **[Github](https://github.com/SriS126)**: i did a lot of cool projects year with my groups and hope to do the same this year. i mainly code simple stuff but want to obviously learn more. 
- **[Robotics Team](https://linktr.ee/ftcruntimeterror)**: I'm a business lead in Runtime Terror 22105. We are in FTC (First Tech Challenge) and I often help organize events. This includes teaching kids about STEM and letting them use makey-makey kits.
